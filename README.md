# UBE - Universal Backend Engine

<img src="ube.png" alt="drawing" width="250"/>

`UBE` is a system for creating customer solutions rapidly.  
It provides the basic needs for teams delivering a customer solution.

## Motivation

Building backends and pipelines for customers is a time consuming process. What if it could be done faster?

## Goals

The `UBE` repository has multiple goals.

### Principal goals of the code

- The code
  - will be simplified for easy maintenance
  - will be fully tested
  - will be fully documented inside the source
  - will be tagged for each release
  - we should try to maintain compatibility amongst releases as much as possible

## Share knowledge & Feedback

At first this will be Work in Progress (or even a Proof of Concept) to collect some feedback.

## Roadmap

To begin with, UBE will be using:
- an incoming message mechanism
- synchronous and asynchronous processing
- a queueing mechanism
- a retrying mechanism
- a logging mechanism
- a testing mechanism
- an idempotency mechanism
- a failure handling mechanism

Depending on common needs and insights, we might add extra functionality.
