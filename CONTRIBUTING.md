# **How to contribute**

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the UBE project.  
These are mostly guidelines, not rules, so use your best judgement and   
feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## **First steps**
Read the README.md so you get an idea what this project is about.  

## **Want to add a new feature?**
The first thing to do is check to see if it is not in the issues.  
If it is not, then create an issue.

> Be aware that this starts by writing a technical design plan, adding as much detail as possible, assign it to yourself and get started.  
> That plan needs to be approved by zale144.

> Beware that it is not all about coding, but also involves writing documentation.
## **Did you find a bug?**

If it isn't on the board, create an issue with as much information as possible. 
> preferably with steps to replicate the problem

> Be aware that this starts by writing/changing a technical design plan.
> That plan needs to be approved by zale144.

## **Submitting**
Always write clear messages for your commits. One line messages are fine for small, simple changes but more information is required for larger, more complex changes.

When creating a Pull Request, thoroughly fill out the PR template.  

## **Code Conventions**

Run the `make all` before you commit.

That will run all the tools, like testing and linting.


We try to leave the codebase in a better state than we found it  
so if you see that something needs refactoring, make the change.
(that means: make an issue about it first!)
